# oliverschwarz-kirby

This is a repository to host my the custom adjustments for my personal website backend based on the cm system Kirby 4. It contains the templates and chunks that I need in the backend to run the site.

## Versions

I am currently working on version 2 of the website layout. After almost 8 years there is an urge to change :) However, you can still access v1.0 in the **branches** section here at github.

## Goals for version 2

* Even more minimalistic
* Introduce tags
* Introduce a search
* Show latest article first
* Move my info to 'about' section
* More simple archive
* Introduce a sitemap
* Use more of the Kirby features
* Introduce meta content (robots, human...)
